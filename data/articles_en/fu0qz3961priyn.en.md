> *This article contains promotional content.*

## Introduction

"Oita Prefecture is No. 1 in the nation for medical distribution" — when you hear this, how do you feel? Do you dismiss it as just a statistical figure, or do you want to dig deeper into the truth behind it? The article "Is 'Oita is Medical Distribution No. 1' True? — A Story of Trying to Break My Own Conclusion with 22 Years of Time-Series Data" ([https://qiita.com/d94231/items/99fc9aeea8be4ac3f2bd](https://qiita.com/d94231/items/99fc9aeea8be4ac3f2bd)) published on Qiita, is a masterpiece of data analysis where the author, driven by the latter impulse, uses a massive 22 years of time-series data as a weapon to thoroughly verify "common sense" and break down their own hypothesis.

In this article, we will introduce the appeal of the data analysis presented in this Qiita article and the deep insights obtained from it. Not just a list of facts, let's explore the fun of deciphering data and the answers to the question "why" that emerge from it together.

## Main Analysis Points of the Article: Truth Told by Data

The greatest appeal of this Qiita article lies in its thorough data analysis approach. By utilizing long-term time-series data spanning 22 years, rather than just single-year data, the author uncovers trends and changes hidden behind superficial numbers.

1.  **Multifaceted Interpretation of "Medical Distribution":** The author first cuts into the multiple possible interpretations of the phrase "No. 1 in medical distribution." Does it indicate a geographical bias in medical institutions, or does it indicate the diversity of the medical provision system? By redefining the indicator from various angles, the author leads us to more essential questions.
2.  **Visualization of Change via Time-Series Data:** By tracking data over the past 22 years, it becomes clear how the medical situation in Oita Prefecture has shifted. Changes in population, the increase/decrease in the number of medical institutions, and their impact on distribution—dynamic changes invisible in static snapshots—are presented with graphs and figures.
3.  **Attitude of Breaking One's Own Hypothesis:** Instead of blindly believing the existing information that "Oita is No. 1 in medical distribution," the attitude of scientific inquiry is maintained throughout: doubting "Is it true?" and correcting even one's initial conclusions based on data. This allows readers to strongly feel the objective perspective and trust in the data.

## Analysis Methods and Approach to Data

Although there are few detailed descriptions of specific analysis methods in the article, the fact that it handles 22 years of data and presents various graphs and calculation results suggests that advanced data processing and analysis skills are used. It is presumed that data science methods using programming languages like Python or R, or analysis utilizing Excel and BI tools, are being performed.

*   **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** The process of efficiently collecting necessary information from published statistical data and formatting it for analysis is a crucial step that determines the success or failure of data analysis.
*   **Definition and Calculation of Indicators:** The thought process itself—with what logic complex indicators like "medical distribution" are defined and calculated as concrete numbers—is a learning experience.
*   **Insight through Visualization:** Bar graphs, line graphs, etc., are effectively used so that data changes and comparisons can be understood at a glance. Appropriate graph selection is indispensable for drawing deep insights from complex data.

## Lessons Learned from the Article (Pros/Cons)

### Pros (Benefits and Learnings)

*   **Importance of Objectivity Based on Data:** It teaches us that the attitude of not swallowing existing information whole, but analyzing data oneself and pursuing the truth, is a very important skill in modern society.
*   **Power of Time-Series Data:** You can experience that by tracking data not just at a single point in time but within the flow of time, you can grasp deeper, more precise situational changes and trends.
*   **Engineering Thinking:** The process of "breaking one's own hypothesis" through data analysis shares common ground with engineering thinking that repeats problem-solving and improvement, and is full of suggestions for many business people.
*   **Contribution to Regional Issues:** It makes us feel the possibility of contributing to solving problems faced by regions by cutting deeply into a familiar social issue like healthcare with a data analysis approach.

### Cons (Points to Consider and Future Prospects)

*   **Details of Analysis Methods:** If there were a slightly more detailed explanation of the programming languages, specific code, or statistical methods used, it might serve as a reference for readers when applying it to their own analysis.
*   **Comparison with Other Regions:** The focus is on Oita Prefecture, but adding comparison data with other prefectures might clarify the specificity of Oita's medical distribution and its position within national trends.
