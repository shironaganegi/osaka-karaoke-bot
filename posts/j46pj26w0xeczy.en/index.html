Introduction: Why AI Pentesters Are Necessary With the proliferation of generative AI like ChatGPT and Claude Code, modern development teams are producing and deploying code at an unprecedented speed. However, as the development cycle accelerates, security testing often fails to keep pace. In many cases, expert penetration testing is conducted only about once a year. This \\u0026ldquo;364-day security gap\\u0026rdquo; is precisely what allows serious vulnerabilities to lurk in production environments.\\n\\u0026ldquo;Shannon\\u0026rdquo; is a fully autonomous AI pentester designed to bridge this massive gap. It hunts down vulnerabilities in web applications without human intervention, and by actually executing exploits, it provides definite security assurance free from false positives.\\n[!NOTE] Shannon Lite has achieved an astonishing success rate of 96.15% on the XBOW benchmark, using no hints and access to source code. Details here: Shannon Lite achieves a 96.15% success rate on XBOW benchmark.\\n2. Key Features of Shannon What sets Shannon apart from conventional security tools is its \\u0026ldquo;autonomy\\u0026rdquo; and \\u0026ldquo;verification capability.\\u0026rdquo;\\n2.1 Fully Autonomous Operation Penetration testing is no longer a task reserved solely for specialists. Shannon can initiate a test with a single command. The AI autonomously handles complex 2FA/TOTP login processes and browser interactions, automatically completing everything from formulating the attack strategy to generating the final report.\\n2.2 Proof via Actual Exploitation (Elimination of False Positives) Traditional DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) tools often flag \\u0026ldquo;potential vulnerabilities\\u0026rdquo; as alerts, requiring engineers to spend time validating their authenticity. Shannon executes actual exploits—such as SQL injection and authentication bypass—to prove that a vulnerability is genuinely exploitable. This eliminates false positives and allows teams to focus only on issues that require immediate remediation.\\n2.3 Code-Aware Dynamic Testing (White-box) Shannon analyzes the application\\u0026rsquo;s source code to intelligently guide its attack strategies. It integrates existing security tools like Nmap and Subfinder while performing live tests against the running application. This is an advanced form of penetration testing made possible precisely because the tool understands the source code.\\n👇 Recommended Services for Engineers 👇 🌐 Get your unique domain at \\u0026ldquo;Onamae.com\\u0026rdquo;. TechTrend Watch uses it too!\\n3. The Engineer\\u0026rsquo;s Perspective: Shannon\\u0026rsquo;s True Value in the Age of AI Since the introduction of ChatGPT, the growing divergence between \\u0026ldquo;the speed at which AI writes code\\u0026rdquo; and \\u0026ldquo;the speed at which humans ensure security\\u0026rdquo; has become the biggest concern for engineering teams. Shannon provides a powerful solution to this problem.\\n3.1 Integration into the Development Lifecycle Security testing can be integrated as part of the CI/CD pipeline, rather than remaining a once-a-year event. Specifically, automated pentests can be executed whenever a new feature is released or a critical commit is made, accelerating DevSecOps without security becoming a bottleneck to development.\\n3.2 Comparison with Existing Tools and Advantages While typical SAST (Static Analysis) tools report \\u0026ldquo;potential bugs,\\u0026rdquo; Shannon provides \\u0026ldquo;actually exploitable attack paths\\u0026rdquo; complete with a Proof of Concept (PoC). This significantly reduces communication costs between security and development teams. By leveraging advanced data flow analysis engines (Pro version), the AI can also discover complex logic flow vulnerabilities that humans might overlook.\\n3.3 Challenges in the Japanese Enterprise Environment Shannon Lite is a \\u0026ldquo;white-box\\u0026rdquo; tester, meaning it requires access to source code. In strict Japanese enterprise environments with rigid security policies, permitting this source code access might pose a barrier to adoption. However, for organizations adopting modern DevOps and pushing security shift-left, enhancing code visibility and resolving issues early is an indispensable step.\\n4. Deployment and Usage 4.1 Product Lineup Shannon offers Shannon Lite (AGPL-3.0), which provides the open-source core framework, and Shannon Pro (Commercial License), which offers more sophisticated LLM-powered data flow analysis, enterprise features, and dedicated support.\\nFor enterprises aiming for CI/CD integration and advanced compliance automation (such as SOC 2, HIPAA), the Pro version, which is part of the Keygraph Security and Compliance Platform, is the optimal choice.\\n➡️ Learn more about the Keygraph Platform\\n4.2 How to Use (Shannon Lite) Shannon Lite is publicly available on the GitHub repository. Basic usage involves simply specifying the target application\\u0026rsquo;s source code and running a single command. Examples of vulnerability discovery and detailed reports from testing the OWASP Juice Shop are also published.\\nShannon GitHub Repository\\n5. Summary Pros (Advantages) High success rate of 96.15% and elimination of false positives Continuous and autonomous penetration testing tailored to development speed Pentester-grade, highly reproducible PoC reports Cons (Considerations) Shannon Lite is limited to white-box testing (source code access required) Advanced enterprise features are provided in the Pro version In an era where lightning-fast development powered by AI is the standard, \\u0026ldquo;Shannon\\u0026rdquo; will prove to be the most powerful red team tool for modern engineering teams committed to not leaving security behind.\\nThis article is also available in Japanese.\\n\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"大阪カラオケナビ運営\"},\"dateModified\":\"2026-02-08T11:16:02.520976Z\",\"datePublished\":\"2026-02-08T11:16:02.520976Z\",\"description\":\"Introduction to New AI Tool: shannon (English)\",\"headline\":\"New AI Tool: shannon (English)\",\"inLanguage\":\"ja\",\"keywords\":[\"AI\",\"Tools\"],\"mainEntityOfPage\":{\"@id\":\"https://shironaganegi.github.io/osaka-karaoke-bot/posts/j46pj26w0xeczy.en/\",\"@type\":\"WebPage\"},\"name\":\"New AI Tool: shannon (English)\",\"publisher\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"url\":\"https://shironaganegi.github.io/osaka-karaoke-bot/favicon.ico\"},\"name\":\"大阪カラオケ料金ナビ\"},\"wordCount\":802}"</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://shironaganegi.github.io/osaka-karaoke-bot/ accesskey=h title="大阪カラオケ料金ナビ (Alt + H)">大阪カラオケ料金ナビ</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
