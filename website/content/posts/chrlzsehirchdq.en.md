## Turning Claude into the Ultimate "Automated Execution AI": Leveraging the Undiscovered Awesome Claude Skills

> *This article contains promotional content.*

### Introduction: Beyond Text Generation

Anthropic's Claude is one of the most talked-about AI models today, thanks to its astonishing reasoning power and long context handling capabilities. However, many users only know the extent of Claude's "text generation" ability. Claude's true potential lies in its "Claude Skills"—the ability to integrate with external services and perform real-world actions.

This article introduces *Awesome Claude Skills*, a curated collection of resources designed to maximize this potential. We will explain how engineers and those seeking to boost productivity in their side hustles can transform Claude into a "functional AI agent."

### 1. What Are Claude Skills? – The Power to Standardize Routine Tasks

Claude Skills are customizable workflows that enable Claude to perform specific tasks according to user-defined requirements. They are activated by specific commands or prompts and provide an interface for Claude to interact with external data and applications.

**Why Are Skills Necessary?**

If you instruct an AI to "send an email" or "update a spreadsheet," it usually just generates text. However, by implementing Skills, Claude can execute real-world actions in a standardized manner, such as the following examples.

### 2. Key Features: Automating Over 500 Applications

A particularly noteworthy aspect of *Awesome Claude Skills* is the extensive application integration enabled by Composio.

#### 2.1. The Integration Revolution via the connect-apps Plugin

Using this plugin, Claude evolves from a mere information processing tool into an agent capable of actually executing business tasks. For instance, it can integrate with over 500 applications to perform actions like creating GitHub issues, posting messages to Slack, manipulating Google Drive, and sending emails.

#### 2.2. Development and Coding Tools for Engineers

Developers can utilize skill sets that streamline code-related tasks, such as artifacts-builder (for modern Web UI generation), aws-skills (for supporting AWS development best practices), and the Changelog Generator.

#### 2.3. Advanced Document Processing

Skills are provided to directly read, edit, and analyze major office documents like PDF, Word (docx), PowerPoint (pptx), and Excel (xlsx). This enables advanced data processing that was difficult to achieve with ChatGPT alone.

### 3. Quickstart: Steps for Installing the 'connect-apps' Plugin

To try out the most powerful feature—external integration—follow these steps to install the `connect-apps` plugin.

1.  **Install the Plugin**

    ```bash
    claude --plugin-dir ./connect-apps-plugin
    ```

2.  **Run Setup**

    ```
    /connect-apps:setup
    ```

    Enter the API key (which can be obtained for free from Composio).

3.  **Restart and Execute**

    Restart Claude and try an action, such as "send a test email to yourself." A successful execution is proof that Claude is connected to over 500 applications.

### 4. Pros and Cons

| Item | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Productivity** | Drastic automation of routine tasks significantly reduces work time. Contributes to freeing up time for side hustles. | Requires some technical knowledge for initial setup, especially command-line operations. |
| **Versatility** | Integration with over 500 applications allows coverage of almost all business processes. | Detailed explanations and community information in Japanese are still scarce, requiring self-sufficiency in troubleshooting. |
| **Development** | AI supports the entire development lifecycle, including GitHub integration and log analysis, not just code generation. | Requires careful management of API keys and security configurations. |

### 5. Conclusion: The Next Level of AI Utilization

Claude Skills, and the *Awesome Claude Skills* list that compiles them, are the key to utilizing AI not merely as a conversational partner but as a "powerful automation tool."

This list is full of insights that can dramatically boost productivity, especially for Japanese engineers and those seeking new sources of income using AI.

Be sure to check the official repository and evolve your Claude to the next level.
