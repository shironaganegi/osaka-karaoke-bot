# [Yen Depreciation Re-accelerates] Before Your Yen "Rots": 3 Asset Strategies to Protect and Grow Your Wealth, Taught by a Pro

### The Numbers in Your Bank Account Are Growing, but Your Purchasing Power Is Shrinking

"Another price hike, huh?"

How many times have you muttered those words while looking at convenience store shelves or gas station signs? Following the latest US employment statistics, the foreign exchange market has once again floored the accelerator toward a weaker yen. The assets we have worked so hard to earn and save—assets denominated in "Japanese Yen"—are losing their global value at an invisible, relentless speed.

The old common sense—that your money is safe as long as it's in the bank—has been incinerated by the "silent fire" of inflation. If you maintain your current asset allocation, the level of wealth you can afford with the same amount of money might be cut in half in just a few years. This article is here to share a mindset for resisting this harsh reality: how to "protect and grow" your assets simultaneously.

### Fear of Investment Is Proof That You Are Rational

"I don't want to lose money." "I don't know where to start." If you find yourself hesitating, it’s because you view your money seriously—as an integral part of your life.

For an investor, that caution is your strongest defensive wall. I am not suggesting you become a reckless gambler. Instead, I want you to convert that anxiety into "intellectual curiosity" and transform it into a weapon backed by logic. The courage to take the first step is born from the conviction that comes with knowledge.

### Why You Must Redefine Your "Asset Allocation" Now

The gears of the global economy continue to turn with more cold indifference than we realize. There are three key points to focus on:

- **The Unbridgeable "Temperature Gap" Between Japan and the US**: US interest rates are pulling global capital like a force of gravity. The torrent of investors selling Yen to move into interest-bearing Dollars will not stop overnight.
- **The Necessity of "Digital Gold"**: When the value of fiat currencies wavers, Bitcoin—with its supply strictly limited by programming—shines brighter as a safe haven. This is not mere speculation; it is a shift toward mathematical trust.
- **From "Single-Point Focus" to "All-Directional" Strategy**: Relying solely on the currency of a single nation like the Yen is like staying on a sinking ship. Foreign currencies, commodities, and growth assets—diversification is the strongest armor in the modern era.

If you look at the data calmly, you will realize that moving a portion of your assets into the "wave of growth" is no longer a luxury—it is a survival strategy.

In the voyage known as asset management, choosing your platform is like choosing the "hull" of your ship. You need robustness to withstand rough seas, intuitive operability to decipher ever-changing nautical charts, and transparency that eliminates hidden costs. The tools I have carefully selected possess the specifications to satisfy everyone from beginners to professionals.

### The Decisive Difference Between Those Who Act Now and Those Standing Still in a Year

In a market undergoing dramatic shifts, the gap between those who begin riding the wave of information and those who merely watch from the pier will manifest as a brutal difference in asset balances a year from now.
The most terrifying thing is not losing money. It is "opportunity cost"—losing the chances you should have grasped by choosing to do nothing.

### A New Landscape of Wealth Building Starts with a "0.1 Step"

You don't need to invest your entire fortune at once. Start by opening an account and setting up an automated contribution equivalent to the cost of a single cup of coffee. That small "0.1 step" will become a powerful foundation that saves your future self.

Start preparing now, in this very moment, so your future self can thank you.
